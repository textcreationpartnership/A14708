            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no leſse benefite that wee haue knowledge of our creation, redemption, preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eternall ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how to beleue, loue, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, honor, and ſhewe our ſelues thankefull vnto our creator, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer, preſeruer, &amp;c. than that he hath beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed theſe great and inestimable giftes vpon vs, of his mercie and free goodneſſe. Neither auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it vs to bee borne and made men and not brute beaſtes, and that Christ hath died, riſen again, and aſcended into heauen, if we know not the ende of our creation and redemption, to be to glorifie god, to ſet forth his prayſe, and to tell of his wonderfull works. This is eternall life, ſaith Chriſt, to know thee the only and true God, and him whom thou hast ſent Ieſus Christ. We had neuer knowne God, we had neuer knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, except he had inſpired his holye ones with hys
<pb facs="tcp:3186:3"/>
ſpirit, and enforced them to write the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein he hath reueled himſelfe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested his will in all things neceſſarie towardes vs. Wherefore we ought first of all to bee moste thankefull to God, and in all things to bleſſe his name, both for his fatherly fauor, which he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth towards vs, and alſo for reueling the ſame by his worde. Secondly, they be alſo worthie of their due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which as Gods inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and workemen of God, haue laboured with him to ſet forth the ſame worde of the knowledge of ſaluation.</p>
            <p>There are great and weightie cauſes which haue moued God to vtter himſelfe in his worde. Firſt, that he might ſet forth his loue, wiſedome, omnipotencie, goodneſs &amp; fidelitie to the world, which we had neuer knowne without his word. God who is faythful (ſayth August. <hi>Pſa. 110.</hi>) hath made him ſelfe our debtor, not in taking any thing of vs, but in promiſing vs ſo great things. It ſeemed but a ſmall thing to promiſe, but hee hath alſo bounde himſelfe with ſcripture as it were making with vs a handwriting of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. He hath not onely made a writing with men that they might beleue, but he hath further appoynted his only ſonne to be a mediatour of his
<pb facs="tcp:3186:3"/>
fidelitie and truth. Wherefore all the worlde is of dutie bounde to giue most heartie and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall thankes to God the onely authour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of ſo great benefites, howſoeuer otherwiſe the world do contemne, neglect and abuſe this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Secondly, that the remembrance of this most holy couenant betwene God &amp; his church, might bee more durable, &amp; the promiſe might be more certainly ſet forth to all posteritie. And therefore he hath charged the things to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, taught, and learned of them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the promulgation of his worde, and of them that ſhould come after. &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 102.</hi> Let theſe thinges be written in another generation, that the people whiche ſhall bee borne hereafter may prayſe the Lord. Adam (as Ioſephus teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in the first booke of his antiquities) ſet vp two tables or pillers of ſtone, and wrote in them the beginning of the creation, the fal of man, and the promiſe of Meſſias. After the floud wrote Moſes, and the rest of the Prophets inſpired and led by the ſpirit of God. After the Apoſtles and Euangelists by the ſame ſpirit, whoſe bookes the deuill and all his angels (though they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpited and impugned them) were neuer able either vtterly to destroy or cast them out of the
<pb facs="tcp:3186:4"/>
hands of the people of God, bycauſe God woulde haue his couenant to remain in his Church, and ſo will haue them to the worldes ende, <hi>Rumpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ilia Codro,</hi> though the deuyll do burste his guttes. &amp;c. Thirdly, that God will haue hys Church which is the piller and ſtay of the truth <hi>1. Tim. 3.</hi> as in many other things to differ from ſectes, factions, vaine opinions and ſuperstitious of other Gentiles, ſo in this poynt chiefly to bee a keeper and as it were a librarie of the bookes of his Prophets and Apoſtles, wherein he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe to the worlde. Wherefore all men are bounde that will bee of the true Church of God, to keepe, reade and exerciſe them ſelues in the true vnderstanding &amp; practiſing of theſe bookes. Fourthly, that the keeping and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe bookes, may be a notable and certain testimonie of the truth, and of the will of God, in all matters of Religion, and a ſtrong fortreſſe both agaynst all ſuperstitious, mans feigninges and deuiſes, and alſo agaynst al vaine &amp; phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall ſpirites preferring their owne dreames and fonde imaginations before the certaintie of Gods ſcriptures. Our gracious God therefore knowing the neceſſitie, and the inestimable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the ſcriptures, will haue them ſette forth,
<pb facs="tcp:3186:4"/>
kept and exerciſed of his Church for euer. The ſcripture is the worde of truth, of life, the goſpell of health, the power of God to ſaluation. &amp;c. the foode of the ſoule, the light to our feete, the ſword of the ſpirite, the breath of Gods mouth, which who ſo wanteth runneth into errour, into death, and deſtruction, is without all comfort of helpe, periſheth for foode, wandreth in darkeneſse, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth naked agaynst his armed aduerſaries, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Gods grace and ſpirite, which who ſo wanteth, is none of Gods people. <hi>Rom. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god ought to haue their iust co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation which were the iust inſtruments of gods ſpirit, in writing theſe ſcripturs, not to take any glorie from God and aſcribe it vnto men (which were meere Jdolatrie, and woulde make men arrogant and glorye in them ſelues) but to encourage men to laboure with the Lord, and to knowe that their laboure in him is, to ſet foorthe his glorie, to profite his Churche, and that they them ſelues ſhal be pertakers of eternall felicitie. <hi>Dani. 12.</hi> They that be learned ſhall ſhine as the ſunne &amp;, they that haue inſtructed many in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhal be as the ſtars for euermore: theſe haue not ſpoken of them ſelues nor the wiſdome of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of God, <hi>He. 1.</hi> God hath ſpoken in alder time
<pb facs="tcp:3186:5"/>
many and ſundrie wayes to our fathers by his Prophetes. &amp;c. He ſayth not they ſpake of them ſelues, but God by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they came not with their owne worde, nor their owne authoritie, but euer they ſayde, <hi>Haec dicit dominus,</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord. Paule ſaith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> all the ſcripture is inspired by the holy ghoſt. &amp;c. &amp; <hi>2. Pet. 1.</hi> We haue a ſure &amp; certain worde of the Prophets which (ſaith he) was not brought in by the will of man, but the holy men of God haue ſpoken being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled by the ſpirite of God. Therefore for their obedience to Gods ſpirite, for their diligence in trauell and paines, for their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie in true handling and vttering their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, they bee well to bee thought of and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their iust co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, by whoſe meanes we haue receyued the will of God, the worde of eternall life. But ſome thinke the Prophetes and the Bokes of the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pertayned to the Iewes only, and are now aboliſhed and permine nothing to vs, to what purpoſe ſhould wee keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or labor to vnderstand them? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ceremonies of the olde Law, we know that lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they be fulfilled by Chriſt, and in him fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and vtterly abolyſhed, yet ſpiritually we are bound to obſerue them ſtill, as the ſpirituall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
<pb facs="tcp:3186:5"/>
ſpirituall ſacrifices, ſpirituall ſabboth or reſt from ſinne and ſuch like: the Moral law is the lawe of nature and the eternall lawe of God, and therefore for euer to be kept of vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Testament: the Prophecie of Chriſt and his Churche, &amp;c. as they were promiſed in the olde Testament, ſo are they truely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the newe. Therefore the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the newe containe both one thing, the times are changed, he ſhall come, and he is come, the matter is one in this word come: as the olde Teſtament is the fountaine where out of the new doth iſſue as the ſame liuely water of the ſpring: ſo is the newe Teſtament the lighte and brighte ſhine of the olde. What is the newe Testament but a plaine expoſition of the olde? we may not ſo expound the newe ſcripture that we take awaye the olde whereon the newe is grounded. If the old ſcriptures are aboliſhed, why doe the Apoſtles apply them to the Gentiles, whom they laboure by the ſcriptures to make the people of God? why are the noble men of Theſſalonica co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Act. 17.</hi> for ſearching the olde ſcriptures, &amp; thereby proued Paules doctrine to be true? If the olde ſcripture be abrogate, why did Paule af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme before king Agrippa. <hi>Act. 26.</hi> that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:3186:6"/>
to ſerue their owne deuiſes, and woulde ſeeme to ſee ſomething that neuer man ſaw before them. Concerning them that cauill the ſcriptures to be hard and obſcure and therfore not to be ſtudied, the plaine contrarie is true. For if a thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie be difficult, the more paine is to be taken for the obtaining of the ſame. The ſcriptures are like vnto the ſea whiche hath a ſhallowe ſhore, where the lambe may drynke and refreſhe him ſelfe: and a bottomleſſe depth, where the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and other great beastes may ſwimme and feele no bottome: ſo hath the ſcriptures plaine leſſons to nouriſh all men though they be but ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, and deeper mysteries wherin greater learned men may bee occupied ſtill, and yet not in thys life come to the fulneſse of knowledge: but euery one according to the meaſure that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Euery art and ſcience is hard to him that neuer ſtudied for it. No man is borne an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, but by ſtudie he commeth to knowledge of artes, ſome difficultie there is in ſcriptures to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which bee not conuerſaunt therein, by reaſon of ſtraunge phraſes, figures, tropes, and vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the tongue wherin they were written. And as Gregorie ſayth, the obſcuritie of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures bring vtilitie, that a mans witte may bee
<pb facs="tcp:3186:6"/>
exerciſed, and being weried with labour may bee enlarged. And he that ſo is exerciſed may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue and vnderstand that which an ydle man cannot vnderstande. Yea and this difficultie hath yet a greater thing. For if the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſcriptures in all things were plaine, it woulde waxe vile and of no estimation, but when the ſenſe is founde in certaine obſcure pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it ſo much delighteth more with a greater ſweetneſse, as the ſeeking thereof did wearye the mynde wyth paynefull labour.</p>
            <p>Christ therefore willeth (as well for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the worde as other neceſsaries) aſke and ye ſhal receiue, ſeeke and ye ſhal find, knock. &amp;c. Aſke by prayer, ſeke by reding and ſtudie, knock by perſeuerance and it ſhall be opened. <hi>Pſal. 119.</hi> Maruellous are thy testimonies O Lorde, and therefore my ſoule ſearcheth them exceedingly. Againe, bleſſed are they that ſearche his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and ſeeke him with their whole hearte. <hi>Iohn. 5.</hi> Searche the ſcriptures for in them. &amp;c. He ſayth not reade them, or ſay them, with lip labour, or for a custome, or negligently, but ſearch and ſeeke out the true vnderstanding of them. Christ opened the ſcriptures to the two diſciples whiche went to Emaus, bycauſe they were tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb facs="tcp:3186:7"/>
conferring and ſearching the ſcripture. Phillip was commaunded to teach the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine by the ſpirite, the true meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Eſay, bycauſe he was dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in reading &amp; ſearching that which as yet then he vnderſtode not: wherefore the ſcriptures are not difficulte to the Children of God, which praye, laboure, ſeeke and knock to God for the opening of them, but to the wicked, as Peter writeth that in Paules epiſtles ſome things are hard to be vnderſtand, but he ſheweth to whome they be ſo, for he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, whiche they that be vnlearned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steadfast do wreaſt as the other Scriptures to their owne destruction, ſo that, to the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the vnexerciſed, the malicious, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſlothfull and ſluggiſh, they be only harde and difficult, and to ſuch as loue not the truth, for he that doth euill hateth the light, and this is condemnation, that lighte is come into the world and men loued darkeneſſe more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light <hi>2.</hi> Corinth. <hi>1.</hi> Jf our Goſpell be hid yet. &amp;c. loke the place, the ſcriptures are not darkneſse but light. Pſalm. <hi>119. 2.</hi> Peter. <hi>1.</hi> therefore they are not to be lightned of darkneſſe, but to lighten the darkeneſſe. Therefore the holy ghost that gaue the ſcriptures, hathe his working in hys
<pb facs="tcp:3186:7"/>
Church to open and make playne the ſame to his, that in ſinceritie ſearch them. But (to come to the ſecond ſorte) although the ſcriptures be playne vnto the elect, yet are they ſo by laboure and ſtudie and not by idleneſſe and negligence. Gregory compareth them to a ſtone in whiche there lyeth fire hid, for the ſtone being holden in the hand is colde, but being ſtriken with i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron it glistereth with fire which will burne the hand: ſo the ſcriptures caried only in the hands or in the tong, are but colde, but beaten with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, they kindle the harte and ſet it on fier with true loue. Luke. <hi>24.</hi> did not our hart burne within vs while he talked with vs? ſayde the two diſciples. They are alſo like a treaſure hid in the field, as one ſaid to his ſonnes on his death bed, my children there is a great treaſure hid in this litle cloſe, if ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> find it. After his death they did plough vp the grounde, thinking there to finde golde, but when they found none, they ſewe the ground with wheat, it yelded great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and ſo continued from yeare to yeare till in deede they had thereout of greate treaſure. So the ſcriptures being trimmed, bring greate frute, which being neglected, they will not doe. There is fine flower in the corne, but it must be
<pb facs="tcp:3186:8"/>
threſht and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d before we come to the meale. There is a ſwete cornell in the nutte, but wee muſt break the ſhell before we come to the meat. Men are not nowe called and taught immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly from God as the olde prophets were, but by meanes of praying, reading, meditating, and conferring with others: euery man is not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, which can ſay the letter without the booke and rehearſe the words of the texte: let euery man meaſure him ſelfe with his owne fote, and be not aſhamed to confeſse his ignoraunce, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with others, and learne that he knew not before, and giue God thankes for reuealing his word, and thinke well of them by whoſe meanes he is made better learned. When Moyſes had giuen a lawe from God to the Jſraelites, he made a commentarie or expoſition of the ſame called Deutronomie, for their eaſier vnderstanding. Were not the writings and ſermons of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, expoſitions and applications of Moyſes lawe vnto the times and perſons, as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to reproue wicked men to their faces for diſobedience to the ſame? Although ſome to flatter their feygned friends, do lay pillowes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mens elbowes and as falſe prophets do, dare vndertake that it is not lawful to reproue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb facs="tcp:3186:8"/>
euill men, the word of God and examples of true embaſsadours of God is to the contrarie. Did not Eſdras reade the lawe, and the Leuites expound it? did not Chriſt expound many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the olde testament which elſe we had not rightly vnderstand, as in the <hi>.12.</hi> of Mathew co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Ionas. Jn the <hi>.4.</hi> of Luke the place of Eſay, and in the <hi>.24.</hi> of Luke. Who could haue gathered out of this place of Math. <hi>22.</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, J am the God of Abraham, Jſaac &amp;c. if Christ had not expounded it? did not Peter Acts. <hi>2.</hi> expound the <hi>.16.</hi> Pſalme, and the Pſalme. <hi>110.</hi> of Christes reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and made a large and a learned ſermon? Did not Philippe preach and make expoſition of the place of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to the chamberlayne Acts. <hi>8.</hi> be not Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les epistles full of expoſitions and openings of the olde prophets? It may be obiected that all theſe are ſcripture, and now it is made ſo plaine one with another, that there nedeth no further ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. God hath lefte in his Churche prophetes, ſuch as do expound the old prophets. <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>14.</hi> pastours, builders, and ſuche like, therefore the olde biſhops and fathers of the Church haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes taught and defended the Churche by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting theſe ſcriptures: ſome haue written
<pb facs="tcp:3186:9"/>
Apologies and defences of Chriſtes religion, ſome exhortations to constancie and martyrdome, ſome haue confuted hereſies whiche alwayes do growe when men are aſleepe, ſome wrote home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for the people, ſome made commentaries and expoſitions of one or moe of the bookes of the olde or newe testament. I ſpeake not of Papiſts and ſchole men whiche were all corruptours of the texte, and that thorough ignorance, but of the auncient fathers within foure or fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares after Christes aſcention, though J muſt leaue vnto them their faults, golde is to be digged out of rotten earth. As Tertullian, Ieremie, Iuſtinus martyr, Origene, Hilarius, Hipolitus, Arnobius, Lactantius, Didimus, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Ambroſe, Hierome, Auguſtine, Baſill, Gregorie Nazianzene, and Gregorie Nycen. &amp;c. all theſe and ſuche like were learned men, and ſuch as defended the Churche of God, and refelled falſe and erronius opinions by declaring and expounding the word of God. How naked and bare were many places of the old teſtament if ſome further ſenſe were not rightly gathered of them than the bare letter? J do not meane to bring all the ſcriptures to Allegories, for that were to destroy the texte and to open a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
<pb facs="tcp:3186:9"/>
for euery wandring ſpirite to flye out at, and to range where he list without grounde, as ſome of olde haue done, and popiſh friers with their dreames haue folowed after, that neyther they nor any man elſe wist whether. But J meane, beſide the historie, there may be other ſenſe well gathered, as of old fathers haue bene. If a man did aske of him that doth ſuperficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reade, what is the meaning in the <hi>.10.</hi> of Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, of this ſaying, that one whele did roll and moue within an other, the literall ſenſe is bare. Gregorie ſaithe that the newe testamente rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the olde, for that which the olde did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, the newe doth exhibite. As for example, out of Adam ſleeping Eue was formed: ſo out of Chriſt dying the Church was formed. As I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac caried wood to the altar wher he ſhould be ſacrifiſed and yet eſcaped: ſo Christ caried the wood of the croſse to be crucified in body, and yet remayned immortall in diuinitie. What meaneth it that the murtherer after the death of the high prieſt ſhould be abſolued and let go home? but that after the death of our high priest Christ, mankinde ſhould be loſed from their ſinnes, and ſent into paradiſe againe. What meaneth it that in the tabernacle was made a
<pb facs="tcp:3186:10"/>
mercy ſtole, ouer whiche were two cherubins of gold. &amp;c. The mercie ſeate, to be ſhort, is Chriſt, the two cherubines be the two testamentes: of golde, for their pureneſſe: they haue wings for that they flye ſwiftlie: they loke each towardes the other, for that they ſet forth both one thing: with their faces towardes the mercie ſeate, for they both haue reſpect to Christ. A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch misteries may be gathered withoute abſurditie or ſuperstition out of the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and referred to the newe. Wherefore let vs be thankefull to God for his word, and for thoſe that haue ſet it forth or by any meanes opened the true ſenſe vnto vs. Amongst others for this ſound expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe two Prophets Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias and Ionas, let vs comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that worthy and learned man and chiefe writer of theſe dayes one of the chiefe preachers at Zurich or Tigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, master Gualter, who both by his continuall preaching and dayly writing, hath much profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christes Church. It was tranſlated by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Ro.

               <p>They haue declared the ſame in tymes paſt by manie tokens, but moſte notable of all other was, that Treaſon and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, whiche they practiſed at the tyme of the Captiuitie of Babylon.

with great offence, for it ſéemed, as though God had vtterly forgotten hys promiſes, and the adoption of the Iewes, when as the poſteritie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> hauing loſt both their kingdome and temple, were alſo caried away captiue, they in the meane ſeaſon being in good eſtate, whiche fette their originall from <hi>Eſau,</hi> and hadde neuer ceaſed to perſequute the iniurie of ſtealing the birthrighte and bleſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: thereby alſo then the oracle of God was layde open to be mocked at, who had ſaid to <hi>Rebecca</hi> being great with childe: <hi>Tvvo nations are in thy vvombe, and tvvo people shall come of thee:</hi>

God therefore coueting to remedy this offence, ſtirred vp <hi>Abdias</hi> to frame this ſermon againſt the <hi>Edomites,</hi> which conſiſteth of two principall partes. In the firſt he threatneth their deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3186:14"/>
and taketh away from them all thoſe things, wherein before they did put any confidence, ſhewing alſo cauſes, why they deſerued ſuche ſubuerſion. In the other parte he prophecieth of the kingdome of Chriſt, that ſhould be reſtored among the Iewes, and from thence ſhould be ſpred among al nations, thoroughout the whole world. So then this prophecie ſerueth to great and very neceſſarie vſe, euen at theſe dayes, when as we heare euery where of the like temptations: whileſt the wicked become inſolente by meanes of their happie ſucceſſe, and the godly thorough their aduerſities and continuall afflictions do in a manner giue ouer. For we are taughte by <hi>Abdias,</hi> that God in déede afflicteth ſuche as are his, their ſinnes ſo deſeruing: but yet, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert vnto him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.</note> he receyueth them to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure agayne, neuer tempting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their power. Farre otherwiſe is the eſtate of the vngodly, who abuſing the tranſitorie felicitie of this worlde to the maintenaunce of their ſuperſtition, and abominable life, neuer in aduerſitie

acknowledging the iuſte reuengement of God, but obſtinately murmuring againſt him, at length periſh for euer. Yea, euen in this worlde alſo dothe God oftentymes ſhew forth examples of his Iuſtice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are taught to the full, that neyther he himſelfe ſléepeth continually, nor yet the felicitie of the vngodly, wherwith they are wont to glorie and ware proude, can be durable or perpetuall.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The title of the worke.</note>Hauing made this Preface, let vs come now to the wordes of this Prophet, (who as it is the maner alſo of the reſte) prefir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a title before his worke in this ſorte: <hi>The viſion of Abdias.</hi> Nowe what hée meaneth by this worde <hi>Viſion,</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe expoundeth afterward, adding: <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord God vnto Edom.</hi> So then this woorde <hi>Viſion,</hi> ſignifieth no other thing, ſaue a Prophecie or word reuealed from God. And ſufficiently are we taught by the hiſtorie of Samuell, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes were in tymes paſte called by the name of <hi>Seers,</hi> namely for God reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto them his will, by Dreames and Viſions, whiche in ſpirite they did ſée.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3186:15"/>
Verie gladly alſo do the Prophets vſe this woorde <hi>Viſion,</hi> therby to giue notice, that they bring not their fantaſies, but the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles receyued from God aboue, whiche only in chriſtian aſſemblies ought to take place, as heretofore hath bene oftentymes ſayde.</p>

               <p>As touching the <hi>Edomites,</hi> that they were ſuche kinde of men, we may eaſily gather, bothe by this <hi>Abdias,</hi> and alſo by the Sermons of other Prophets. So then to frame his talke to their maners, thus doth he begin: <hi>VVee haue hearde a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour from the Lord, and an ambaſſador is ſent to the Heathen: Vp, lette vs aryſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3186:16"/>

               <p>But nowe heare the rumour whiche I haue hearde, and is begoonne not of an vncertayne Authoure, but ſignifyed vnto mée from the Lorde GOD.</p>
               <p>Namely, that hée hathe nowe ſente his ambaſſadoure to the Gentils, that they may take in hande warre againſt you. Neither is this ambaſſage in vaine, for there are already heard euery where the voyces of men, exhorting one an other to fight againſt you. And in playn words the Prophet giueth it out, that God himſelfe is the authour of this tumulte: therby to make anſwer to their reaſons, wherwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they were deceiued, ſuppoſing that it could neuer come to paſſe, that any nation ſhoulde ſet vpon them in warre: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſith they were on the Aſſyrians ſide, vnder whoſe dominion the whole empire of the world was at that ſeaſon.

offended, and thought good to lay this kind of puniſhment vpon them. Namely, for that with like breach of truſt they alſo had oftentimes deceyued others, hauing no conſcience at al for the true keping of their confederacies. For, firſt and foremoſt, as concerning the duetie of brotherly league, which by right of conſanguinitie was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them and the Iewes, they had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſame with deadly and continual hatred.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they meaſured the leagues and frendſhips of men onely by their priuate lucre: and for this cauſe neuer continued faithfull to any, ſo ſone as there appeared either anye hope of greater gaine, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe feare of daunger. By the iuſte iudgemente of God therefore came it to paſſe, that they alſo found them vntruſtie, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by meanes of leagues they hoped for aide and ſuccour.

Beſides this, there muſt be had a coſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that publique peace may be kept, &amp; remaine ſafe for all men: and that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée nothing for our owne priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others.

Thirdly, when as they are religiouſly and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> lawfully ordayned, héede muſt be taken, that the confidence of mind, which oughte to depend vppon God alone, be not beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon our partners or confederates. For they that ſo do, committe idolatrie no leſſe than do the couetous men, whome, for the truſt that they put in their riches, the Apoſtle accuſeth of idolatrie.

In making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſal wherof, he vſeth very many words, thereby to miniſter ocaſion vnto them, to thinke vppon their abhominable factes, and therewithall to declare, that he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of none of thoſe things, whiche we committe againſt the lawes of brotherly loue. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this vpbrayding of deteſtable acts is with diligence to be weyghed, that we may learne thereby, howe gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſentence God pronounceth ouer thoſe things, which amongſt men for the moſt parte are thought ſcarce worthy of blame. Firſt (ſaith he) <hi>Looke not vppon the daie of thy brother:</hi> or, as ſome other interprete it: Be not ſéene in the day of thy brother. For both theſe expoſitions fall to one ſenſe, which is (as he himſelfe afterward expoundeth it) that they ſhuld take no pleaſure or delight in the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their brethren the Iewes. And he termeth it the day of alienation: when as God in ſuche ſorte giueth ouer thoſe that are his, to the lewde luſt of the vngodly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3186:33"/>
that they ſéeme nowe not to be hys chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or of his owne houſhould, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither alients from his family. He addeth alſo: <hi>Open not thy mouth vvide in the day of their tribulation.</hi> That is, take no occaſion by their afflictions to glorie and vaunt of thy ſelfe, and thy ſuperſtitions. And thus doth he gaily paint out the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauioure of the wicked, who perſecuting the godly with ſuch an hatred as will not be reconciled, and in manner commeth by inheritaunce from their forelders, are wonderfully glad at their calamities, and hearing that they are in affliction, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly runne out, not to helpe them with any aide, but with this miſerable ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle to féede their owne cruell mindes. And this they do, both for that they wiſh them euill, and alſo for that they thinke, they haue iuſt cauſe thereby to glory in their owne ſuperſtitions. For then are heard ſuch manner of ſpéeches, as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are accuſtomed to giue open teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of their hatred, and to ſhew forth weightie and iuſt cauſes thereof (if the Goddes be ſo content) and arrogantly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3186:34"/>
to commend their own innocencie: yea they then giue it out, that God is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reuenger of their wrongs: as though he in correcting his children, were wont (in maner of an executioner) to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie and gratifie the rancours of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</p>
               <p>And this is a deteſtable abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Ieremy</hi> alſo and <hi>Daniell</hi> found faulte withall in the <hi>Babylonians,</hi>

Gods Church, as many as holde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within the lappe thereof. <hi>In the mount Sion shal be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſafegard, and it shall be holy. &amp;c.</hi> He ſéemeth to ſet theſe words againſt all the other that he had ſpoken before, of the cruel layings in waite of the Edomites, and euen of all the ennemies of the Churche: as if thys were the ſenſe: Although now ye are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine all kind of miſeries: againe, althogh the Edomites buſie themſelues aboute intercepting of ſuche as do yet remaine, and hauing intercepted them, either ſend them ouer to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> or elſe by force take them away to become theyr ſlaues: yet ſhall they neuer bring it to paſſe, but that vpon mount <hi>Sion</hi> God wil ſet vp his Church, which may be a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie of ſafetie for al that flye therevnto: and that the ſame mount may remayne conſecrate vnto my honoure, in ſuch ſort, that I will not ſuffer it to be continually prophaned of the Gentiles.

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:3186:42"/>
that is to witte, The land, which of olde tyme I promyſed vnto Abraham: or (as others interprete it) they ſhall poſſeſſe ſuche, as at this preſent haue the rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them. And this thing, in the wordes that folowe, by a more plentyfull recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of the partes hee will expreſſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges were partely fulfilled, when as the Iewes retourned out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> inhabited their owne land again, buylded vp the Citie and the Temple, and erected a kynde of kyngdome and common wealthe. Howe bee it, bycauſe they were afterwardes ſundrye wayes afflicted, and laſie of all by the war lyke force of the Romaines, ſette beſide theyr owne land, and vtterly pulled vp by the rootes, wée are inforced of neceſſitie to looke vp higher, namely to Chriſte, who ſuffering at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> vpon the mount Sion, hath purchaſed vnto vs eternall Saluation, and there firſte of all foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Churche, whiche from thence is ſpred abroade ouer the whole worlde.</p>
               <p>And here wée haue to marke, that we haue Saluation ſette out for vs no other

where, than in Sion, which elſewhere. I haue declared, is a figure of the Church. So then thorough it alone doth Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happen vnto men, euen for that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon Chriſt onely, and therefore can no others be partakers thereof, but ſuch as are graft in through true faithe, and ſo become membres of the Churche, wherof he is the only head. As therefore long ſince in the tyme of the floud, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Arke of Noe alone, the remna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of mankinde were ſaued: ſo alſo in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhall they find ſaluation in the church only, as many as flée thervnto. Let theſe things ſerue vs to this end, that both we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly maintein the vnitie of the Church, and alſo manfully ſtande among the myd ſourges of this world, ſith it can not be, that Chriſt ſhould forſake his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, which to this end hath he conſecrate to himſelfe, that therin the pure worſhip of his Name may here be continued, and in tyme to come it may reigne with him in heauen.</p>
               <p>Howbeit it ſéemed an impoſſible thing that the Iews ſhuld at any time recouer
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3186:43"/>
again their poſſeſſions,<note place="margin">The force of the ennemies doth nothing derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promiſes of God.</note> ſéeing that while they kepte in Babylon, the Edomites floriſhed verie greatly, and ſwelled with pride, partly for that they were enriched with the ſpoyles of the Iewes, partly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for that they ſo much truſted vpon the frendſhip of the Babylonians.</p>
               <p>But that all this ſhould derogate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the promiſe of God, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet teacheth by a compariſon. <hi>And the houſe of Iacob shall bee a fyre, and the houſe of Ioſeph a flame, and the houſe of Eſau shall be the ſtravve, vvhich they shal kindle and conſume, ſo that there shall be nothing left of the houſe of Eſau.</hi> He calleth the kingdome of Iuda the houſe of Iacob, and the Iſraelites the houſe of Ioſeph, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt whom y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ephraimits fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their originall from Ioſeph, did in a maner obteyne the chiefe ſoueraigntie.

For they ſhall boyle in heate agaynſt the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3186:43"/>
                  <hi>Edomites,</hi> and being armed with power from God, ſhal ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume them, that that arrogant and inſolent houſe of Eſau ſhal not haue ſo muche as a ſmall remnant, wherby to be hable to ryſe vp againe.</p>
               <p>This was fulfilled as touching the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, when as the nation of the <hi>Edomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> for the iniuries doone againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, was vtterly deſtroyed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers enioyed their lande.</p>
               <p>And this maner of ſpeaking deſerueth eſpecially to be noted, wherin all this is attributed to the Iewes &amp; the Iſraelites, as though they ſhould conſume the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> lyke as the fire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumeth the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Yet do we not reade any where that they did ſo. Notwithſtanding, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet truely affirmeth the ſame, for that beeing moued with his peoples miſerie, (the chiefe cauſers whereof, the <hi>Edomites</hi> were) was himſelf kindled againſt them, and reuenged the iniuries of his people with their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Wherout we haue to fetch a generall doctrine,<note place="margin">The godly at a deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the wicked.</note> namely that the godly ſhal euer be the deſtruction of the wicked, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3186:44"/>
they lay no hand vpon them. For God alwayes fyndeth out ſome ſuche as may perſecute the iniuries done to thoſe that are his. So Loth béeing taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in warre deſtroyed the kings which were conquerours, for that by meanes of him, Abraham folowed vpon them. So the Iſraelites broughte vtter ruine vpon Pharao, the Chananites and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So did Gods Churche alſo bryng vtter ſubuerſion to the Romain empire, when as the Lorde required thereof the bloud of his martyrs. And in this reſpect is it compared to a <hi>ſtone,</hi> whom no man, that is mynded therby to aſſay the ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthe of his arme, can take vp withoute harme. Zach. <hi>12.</hi> And in the meane ſeaſon this may by a myſticall ſenſe be referred to the worde of God, whiche ſoundeth in his Churche, and whereby it is begotten a newe, and kepte in good order.

For the fire with his brightneſſe lightneth all places néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: So doth the word of God enlighten mens minds, and driueth away the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of errors and ignorance: in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration wherof, it is termed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a <hi>light</hi> and a <hi>candle.</hi> The fire with his heat burneth: So dothe the worde of God inflame mens mindes with a loue of heauenly things, and an holie deſire to godlineſſe. By fire, golde and ſiluer are purged, where as it conſumeth all other things: So by the word of God ar the elect wonte to be purged from the corruption of the fleſhe, the vngodly in the meane ſeaſon growing therby worſe and worſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3186:45"/>
for that they being impacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of diſcipline, conceyue thereby an anger and an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, whiche at length bringeth them to deſperation and deſtruction. For they are confounded euen in their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and bicauſe neither by that meanes they wil giue place, at length they horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly periſhe. And hereto ſerueth it, which in the Apocalipſe the <hi>.2.</hi> chap. is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the two witneſſes, oute of whoſe mouth there came a fyre, whereby they auenged them of their enimies. And of Chriſt it is reported, that he ſhould ſmyte the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his mouth ſhoulde kill Antichriſt. <hi>2.</hi> Theſſ. <hi>2.</hi> Thus commeth it to paſſe, that Eſau ſhal haue no remnant left. For whatſoeuer the godly haue in them that is earthly, and ſauoureth of the nature of the worlde, that is wholly by meanes of this heauenly fire by litle and little waſted awaye, that they maye bée wholly renued in euery parte.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3186:52"/>
                     <hi>Ionas</hi> miſdoubting ſome peril to himſelf, deuyſeth to flée away, and hauing taken ſhipping, maketh haſte to an other place. As he is fléeing, god attacheth him by the way, by whoſe prouidence it commeth to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> to ſtil the tempeſt he is faine to be caſt into the ſea, &amp; béeing there ſwalowed vp of a fiſhe of a monſtrous bigneſſe, is thrée dayes after reſtored to drye land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn.

                  <p>Now wheras <hi>Ionas</hi> complayned vpon God for altering his former iudgemente or ſentence, God rendreth him a reaſon why he ſo did. This is the ſumme of this whole hiſtorie, whiche if we ſearch to the bottome, it ſhall well appeare, that what ſoeuer maye ſerue to the knowledge of God and of mannes ſaluation, is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein.

As concerning oure ſaluation, how farre our whole force is from béeing any thing at all, to the deſeruyng of the ſame, it is apparant inough by <hi>Ionas,</hi> who plunged himſelfe ſo far, that he coulde not be haled out againe, but by the myghtie hande of God.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3186:53"/>
al ſtay of our ſaluation to be repoſed) was declared before to bée ſhadowed in this moſt euident figure.</p>
                  <p>In lyke ſort, what ways we muſt vſe for the embracing of this ſaluation, wée are taught by the example of theſe <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites.</hi> They beléeue <hi>Ionas,</hi> preaching the worde of GOD: and that they doe beléeue him, their ſpéedie and earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance beare ſufficient record.

propheticall ſayings, but rather about an hiſtorie. And peraduenture it is not much awrye, which ſome do iudge, being of the opinion, that this little booke was taken out of ſome greater hiſtorical worke, and ſo placed in héere. For this copulatiue coniunction <hi>And,</hi> ſette in the fyrſt fronte therof, ſeemeth to import ſome ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>And</hi> (ſayeth it) <hi>The woorde of the Lorde came vnto Ionas,</hi>

                  <p>As touching the fyrſt, it may not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be paſſed ouer, that althoughe he had before tyme vſed the office of teaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet now he receiueth an eſpeciall precepte, wherby he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to get him to <hi>Niniue.</hi> For we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by this example, that thoſe

Yea while <hi>Ionas</hi> fléeth one peril, he plungeth himſelfe into many other, that are more gréeuous. The lyke alſo haue wée expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of in oure ſelues: neyther is there

any thing more common, than that they are in greate ieopardie for their ſinnes, whiche would faine ſhake of all laboures and perils, that of right they ſhuld vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe for the name of God.

                  <p>This nowe is worthie eſpecially to be noted, that for <hi>Ionas</hi> ſake beeing but one,<note place="margin">For Ionas ſake alone many are in danger.</note> God wrappeth in ſo greate a danger the reſt alſo of the paſſingers &amp; mariners, &amp; beſides that, other ſhippes alſo, whereof it is lyke, there were greater ſtore in the ſame ſea.

                  <p>But let vs paſſe ouer to the third part of this place, wherin is ſet out, what both <hi>Ionas</hi> and alſo the Mariners,<note place="margin">Ionas being in danger ſleepeth.</note> together wyth the reſte of the paſſengers dyd in this ſo great peril. Wheras firſt we haue
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3186:71"/>
to ſpeake of <hi>Ionas.</hi> Hée had gotten hym down vnder the hatches, and there being heauie as it were with a dead ſléep, gaue himſelf to reſt. It may be thought a thing woorthie the wondring at, that neyther the giltineſſe of his ſinne, as yet freſhe in memorie, nor the wearineſſe of ſayling whervnto he was not accuſtomed, nor yet the roughneſſe of the tempeſt now alredy riſen, could ſhake of his ſléepe. Howbeit, ſuche is the nature of ſinne, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs careleſſe, and vnmyndfull of all daunger, if we haue once paſſed ouer the firſt feare, wherewithall we were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for a while. <hi>Ionas</hi> feared nothing but <hi>Niniue,</hi> and hauyng forſaken his natiue countrey, he iudgeth himſelfe nowe in ſafetie: as for Gods ſéeking after him, it is the furtheſt ende of his thoughte: and therfore as though the matter were very wel brought to paſſe, he frameth himſelfe to ſléepe. The very lyke thing may wée eſpie in Dauid, who hearing that <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabe</hi> was great with chyld by meanes of his accompanying with hir, by and by is ſtriken with a feare to runne in infamie,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3186:71"/>
and deuiſeth howe to cloke it: And when as <hi>Vrias</hi> béeing firſt ſlain, he had fetched hir home big with child, forthwith, al fear being layde apart, careleſly he ſluggeth, &amp; ſnorteth in vnlaufull luſtes, vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful both of God, &amp; Gods vengeance, till that he is waked vp by Nathan, and together with the filthineſſe of his horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fact, eſpyeth alſo the danger, which by reaſon therof was readie to fal vpon him. And ſuche lyke ſhal they fynde themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, as many as will thoroughly viewe their conſciences within.</p>
                  <p>Here therfore may we beholde, howe deadly a thing it is to be in bondage vnto ſinne, which bréedeth ſuch a ſecuritie, as wherin we haue no choyſe but to periſh, vnleſſe wée be rayſed vp by the myghtie hand of God. Therwithall alſo brightly ſhineth forth his care ouer vs, who when as we are a ſléep, is waking, &amp; ſtretcheth out his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by his word, or elſe by ſome ſecrete inſpyrings of his Spirit, wherby he maye ſhake of this deadly ſléepe from vs. It ſhall bée oure partes to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame care of his, and not to take

Howbeit then is the vſing of them more daungerous, when as triall is had for offenders, that they may receyue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment: and then in very déed muſt they not be vſed at all aduentures, vnleſſe it ſo be, that God commaundeth:

                  <p>As touching this hiſtorie that we haue in hand, it is credible, that theſe Heathen men, who a little before called vpon ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie goddes, did nowe alſo interlace ſome Superſtition in the vſing of their lottes, which notwithſtanding, God did neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe direct, bicauſe it was expediente, that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſhould be taken tardie.</p>
                  <p>And here yet may we take this warning by the way, that ſuperſtitious crafts can not be excuſed, although nowe and then the truth of a matter may be knowne by their meanes.

And what thing more terrible coulde haue happened vnto him, if all the tirantes of the worlde ſhoulde haue conſpired together, to robbe him of his lyfe?

What other thing was this, than as if he had ben caſt into a graue quick, and immediatly ſmoothered with earth? After al this, yet doth not the iudgement of God (who purſueth him) ſtay there, but ſtraightwaye he méeteth with an huge Fiſh, which with the wide gaping that it maketh, and hauing ranks of teeth ſo terrible, receyueth him, and ſwaloweth him vp: whiche one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to a man of the greateſt courage in the worlde, woulde not onely haue ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him in feare, but alſo haue made his mynde wholly amazed, yea rather full of deſpaire. Moreouer, in this ſo huge a gulfe continueth he thrée days ſpace, and all this while is he waſhed with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the billowes, that are ſwalowed vp: ſometime he is plunged downe into the lowe bottomleſſe places, ſometyme fléeteth he alofte: one whyle he is toſſed to this ſyde, an other whyle to that: and in that vaſte goulfe euery moment ſéeth

he a thouſand deathes before his eyes. What tentations (I beſéeche you) ſhall wée thinke hee was tormented withall? perfectly knowing, that all this adoe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto him thorough Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Surely theſe thinges are ſo outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to be borne, that ten deathes were eaſier, than the abyding of all theſe togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And like plighte are all they in, who to eſchue lighter perils, and ſuche as their owne braynes doe fanſie, ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt God.

For in the couenaunt that he made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, he profeſſeth himſelfe to be <hi>El Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dai,</hi> that is to ſaye, a GOD of all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, who will be vnto vs in maner of <note n="*" place="margin">The latin word here is Copiae cornu: ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etes do feygne) the horne of a Goate, with whoſe milke Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter was nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Creta, of two maidens, Adraſtea, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, daughters of Meliſleus.

                  <p>Heereof we are admoniſhed alſo by the fyrſt precept of the two Tables, wherin

Tim. 2. I knowe in dede, that God in times paſt adorned his temple with excéeding ample promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that Gods Churche hath their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories, wherein prayers may be made: but thoſe olde promiſes had reſpecte vnto Chriſt, whome al that ſeruice of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did ſhadowe: and at this day, for the continuing of holy aſſemblies and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers it is requiſite to haue ſome certaine place, which it is conueniente to kepe holy, and ſundred from all prophane vſes. Yet in the meane ſeaſon, we muſt conſtantly retaine that libertie, whiche God hath granted to euery one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to call vppon him priuately at home and abroade, as ofte as neceſſite heautly oppreſſing vs, or the holy ſpirite ſecretly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3186:105"/>
inſpiring vs, doth ſtirre vs vp to pray.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is expreſſed very diligently,<note place="margin">The time of praying.</note> at what time <hi>Ionas</hi> prayd: <hi>In my trouble</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I cried vnto the Lorde.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>Out of the bellie of the graue,</hi> or, of hell (for the Hebrew word whiche he vſeth here, ſignifieth both) <hi>did I crie.</hi> This ſetteth out the moſt grieuous ſtreightes and afflictions, wherewith the Prophete was aſſailed at that ſeaſon, whereof at this time we néede not to ſpeake, for that he himſelfe wyll afterwarde with more words ſet out at large, what thoughts he had in his minde. This one thing let vs diligently note, that the diſtreſſes whiche he felte both of body and minde, were ſo much the heuter, bycauſe that he knewe, God had laide them vppon him, as being offended with hys ſinne. But he cried vnto the Lorde, and was heard. We ſée then, that afflictions are no lette, but that we may call vppon God: yea that then alſo is it lawfull for vs, euen when we ſuffer puniſhemente, as oure hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinnes haue deſerued. For as GOD in laying hys rodde vppon vs,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3186:106"/>
goeth not aboute oure deſtruction, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement, and as it is not the leaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of oure amendement, if wée tourne vnto him when he ſtriketh vs, crauing helpe at his hande: So doth God alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer caſte them off, who in this maner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues. And bicauſe prayer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth to the confeſſion of our faith, which fayth ſhineth out ſo muche the clée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, as the troubles, wherout we couet to be deliuered, are the gréeuouſer, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that God can not but verie well accept ſuche kynde of prayers.</p>
                  <p>Let this then be oure conſolation, and ſtaye vs vp, when ſo euer the weighing eyther of our puniſhmentes, or of oure ſinnes, ſhall goe aboute to withſtand our prayers, and accuſe vs, as vnworthie to be heard of God. For euen then is it lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tyme to pray, yea then moſt of all is it conuenient to lifte vp our minds whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſtantely to wearie the eares of God: neyther muſt we doubt at all of the fatherly goodneſſe of God, whiche then chiefly extendeth it ſelfe, when hée per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth, that his owne children are in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3186:106"/>
dangerous eſtate of miſcarying.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The maner of praying.</note> let vs alſo mark the maner of <hi>Ionas</hi> prayer. Héerevnto belongeth it, that is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioned of <hi>Ionas</hi> how he prayed vnto God, whome afterward alſo he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his God. This is an excéeding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Faith, ſith that, although hée knewe he had gréeuouſly offended, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the middeſt of his puniſhmentes, he acknowledgeth GOD for his owne: whiche thing fleſhely reaſon will neuer be hable to doe, vnleſſe it be lyghtened with the light of fayth. Againe he ſayth, that he not onely prayed, but alſo cryed, yea that he brayed out, or rather began a tumult in himſelfe. For he vſeth ſuche a worde here, as dothe not ſignifie ſimply to crye, but to be troubleſome to one with crying and yelling. It expreſſeth therfore his feruente and vnceſſant prayers, as wherwithall (if any ſuche thing mighte truly be applyed vnto God) he euen tired God himſelfe. Notable was this change, and full of admiration, which hapned in <hi>Ionas.</hi> For he, who not long before fled from the preſence of God, and ſlepte in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3186:107"/>
careleſſe ſecuritie, nowe béeing found out in his vngraciouſneſſe, cryeth and yelleth out vnto him.</p>
                  <p>And by this example we are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that in praying, before al other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges faith is required, without the which it is vnpoſſible for vs to drawe néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>Hovv shall they call vpon him</hi> (ſayth Paule) <hi>on vvhome they haue not beleeued? Rom.</hi> 10. And Iames in his firſt chapter teſtifieth, that they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing which pray without faith. It will therfore greatly be auaylable for vs, diligently to be conuerſant in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods promiſes and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes done of olde tyme, therby to confirme our ſelues in faithe. But for that God ſometime deferreth his ayde, when as he ſéeth it néedfull eyther to haue vs longer corrected, or our faith ſtill exerciſed: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this confidence in praying, there is alſo a conſtant &amp; inuincible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance required. Therof doth Chriſte put vs in remembrance, whereas he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs not only to pray, but alſo to knock and ſéeke.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.</note> And hereto chiefly tendeth the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3186:107"/>
parable of the widowe, who by hir im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune and continuall crie, at length o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame the eares euen of the wicked iudge. Heinous therfore, and verie hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is their errour, which will preſcribe God certaine limites, and if they be not fauourably heard incontinently, dare call in doubt the goodneſſe and power of God, and vtterly ſurceaſſe from praying for that time. Let vs imitate <hi>Ionas,</hi> &amp; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of others, whoſe faith in times paſt hath pleaſed God: who alſo will heare vs, and ſéeing he is Truth it ſelfe, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fayle to performe his promiſes. And at this preſent, let thoſe things whiche wée haue ſpoken ſuffiſe, as concerning Inuocation and prayers.</p>
                  <p>Nowe paſſe wee ouer to the ſeconde parte of this Canticle,<note place="margin">He enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Gods benefite, by deſcribing the danger wherein he was.</note> wherin he payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth oute the greateneſſe of his peryll, that the benefites of God maye appeare the more excellente.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he hath reſpect vnto God, who by his iudgemente had broughte the matter to that paſſe, that both he was enforced to confeſſe his owne offence, and the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yea though it were agaynſte theyr willes, to caſt him out. By this example of the Prophet, we may learne in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and aduerſities not to bend our eyes toward men alonely, who in ſome parte maye be cauſers vnto vs thereof, but to fire our mynds vpon the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of God, without whoſe good pleaſure ther can no aduerſitie happen vnto vs. This béeing well weighed, moueth vs greatly to repentance, for that it compelleth vs to thinke vpon our ſinnes, wherby we haue prouoked the wrathe of God: it armeth vs alſo with pacience, leſt without cauſe, we ſhoulde raſhly ſtriue againſt God. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> is diligent alſo in ſetting foorth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God did caſte him awaye. <hi>Into the depth, into the hearte of the Seas:</hi> That is to ſaye, into the innermoſte parloure of the Sea, or the verye bottomleſſe place it ſelfe. <hi>And the floudde,</hi> that is,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3186:108"/>
as many flouddes as runne into the ſea, <hi>compaſſed me about: yea all thy dashing vvaues,</hi> that is to ſay, the bruſtlyng none of the waters beating one an other, <hi>And all thy rolles of vvater vvent ouer mee.</hi> For this cauſe calleth he them the waues and billowes of God, for that he is the creator of the ſea, and author of all win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and tempeſtes.</p>
                  <p>And this lot muſt they looke for, which thinke ſcorne to obeye God: that whyle they couete to eſchue ſome one perill, whyche they haue conceyued in theyr mynds, they do nothyng elſe but plunge themſelues into manie, that bothe are more, and alſo gréeuouſer.</p>
                  <p>Yet in this maner of ſpeaking, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſayeth: <hi>All thy rolles of vvater vvente ouer mee,</hi> is conteyned a Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation not to bée contemned. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe many be the tribulations of the righteous, as Dauid witneſſeth, yet doe they in a maner paſſe ouer their heades, neither doth God ſuffer thoſe that are his to be tempted aboue their power. The Prophete furthermore maketh reporte,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3186:109"/>
what he thought béeing incloſed in theſe ſtraightes. <hi>I ſayde, I am caſte out of the ſight of thine eyes.</hi> In theſe wordes hee expreſſeth of all temptations the gréeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt: as wherein he ſuppoſed, that there was no hope of further health lefte vnto him to leane vnto. And ſurely this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Prophet ought diligently to be obſerued. For not long ſince, this was his whole drifte to get him awaye from the preſence of God, and ridde himſelfe of his ſeruice: But now being terrifyed with the feeling of Gods indignation, this only thing is a corſey to his hearte, that Gods countenaunce is hidden from him, and that he feeleth himſelfe excluded ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from by his owne deſerte. Suche a lyke thing doth Chryſte ſhadowe in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the prodigal ſonne.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke.</hi> 15.</note> For he alſo firſt of all, woulde néedes departe from hys father: but when hée was broughte to ſuche néede, as that he beganne to gette his liuing amongeſt ſwyne, then wiſhed he to haue a roomthe, yea though it were amongſt his fathers hired ſeruants, ſo he myghte but enioye the ſyghte of him.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3186:109"/>
The verie ſame thing alſo doe they féele, how many ſoeuer hauing ſhaken of Gods yoke, doe alienate themſelues from him. Yet oughte not the godly to deſpaire, if there ſhall any lyke thing chaunce vnto them: ſeeing wee reade that Chriſte was tempted in ſuche ſorte, that hanging vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe, he cried: <hi>My God, my God, vvhy haſte thou forſaken mee?</hi> Nowe as he dothe yet acknowledge him to bée his owne God, of whome hee complayneth himſelfe to be forſaken: So alſo is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for vs, conſtantly to retaine this principle of Saluation, that we iudge not God eſtraunged from vs, but always recognyſe it to be his Fatherly hande, whiche dothe correcte vs. So doth <hi>Ionas,</hi> when as by way of redreſſing his former thoughte, he addeth:<note place="margin">Correction.</note>

as profeſſed the reuerencing of the true God: And that God woulde accept their prayers, whiche they offered vp there, they had learned before by his promiſes giuen vnto Salomon. Thus therfore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Prophete to ſay in effecte: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all things ſéemed to threaten me a miſchiefe, and as it ſhuld appeare, thou hadſt vtterly caſte me away, yet coulde it neuer ſlippe out of my mynde, but that I belonged to the ſocietie of thy couenant and people: And thence grounded I my hope, that a tyme wold once come, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhoulde againe appeare before thée, and be preſente at thy holie ſolemnities. And ſurely great is this force of Faithe, which after this ſort wraſtleth with the fleſhe, betwéene hope and feare. Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is a true proofe of faithe, when as by conſidering the promiſes of God, and the Sacraments wherwith they are ſealed, it ſuſteyneth it ſelfe vp againſt al temptations. Neyther is this the leaſte commoditie, that wée may reape by the Sacramentes and outwarde profeſſion. For after the ſame maner, had both Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid

and Ionathas regarde vnto circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was a ſeale of the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, when as they called their enimies, Vncircumciſed. But nowe in the meane ſeaſon, there appeareth perfectely in this place, what is the diſpoſition of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: who couet to be deliuered from diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and reſtored to their former eſtate, chiefly to this end, that they maye ſerue God.

had my abiding within the bowels of the Whale, yet had I in mynde bothe thée, and thy couenant: the ſeales wherof, all that worſhip of the Temple ordeyned by thy appoyntment doth conteine.

                  <p>And here may we ſée, howe <hi>Ionas</hi> was occupied chiefly aboute two thinges.

For this reaſon doth the prophet rightly terme them lying vanities, adding thys therwithall, <hi>They that holde of them, vvill forſake his mercie.</hi> By this woorde <hi>Mercie,</hi> he vnderſtandeth euen God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: who, how great ſoeuer he be, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together mercie, and in verie déede the mercie for men: for that he offereth him ſelfe to vs, neyther departeth from vs, vnleſſe wée fyrſt forſake him: as they do which holde of vanities, that is, whiche place not all hope of ſaluation in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but of their owne brayns feigne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues ſtraunge gods. And theſe kinde of men endamage themſelues two maner of wayes: both for that they finde no helpe in thoſe things which they haue forged, &amp; alſo for that therby they forſake God, who alone was able to helpe them. And this is it which God by Hieremie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth of, in theſe wordes: <hi>Tvvo euils hath my people committed: They haue forſaken me the vvel of the vvater of life and digged them pittes, yea vile and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3186:118"/>
pittes, that can hold no vvater. Ier. 2.</hi> And this at this preſente, the Prophete thought good to haue in remembraunce, therby to commend vnto vs the vſe of his owne example, namely that in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we ſhould be myndfull of God and his promiſes: and ſo neyther diſpaire, nor yet ſettle that confidence, which is due to him alone, vpon other vaine things.</p>
                  <p>And here haue we throughly to marke that hée calleth them forſakers of God, which lay holde of vanities. For ſéeing that God is a iealous God, he may not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with any copartners in the faith, &amp; worſhip due to himſelfe. He alſo cryeth by Eſay,<note place="margin">

It foloweth then that ſuperſtitions, and the true worſhip of God, can not both ſtande together: but neceſſarie is it, that they wholly depende vpon GOD, as many as would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted his true woorſhippers.</p>

                  <p>There remaineth now the fourth part of this Canticle, wherein the Prophete voweth thankfulneſſe to God. <hi>But I vvil ſacrifice vnto thee vvyth the voyce of praiſe and vvil pay the things that I haue vovved. &amp;c.</hi> By the voyce of prayſe hee vnderſtandeth thankeſgiuing, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen preaching abroade of the benefite that he had receiued of God.

As though <hi>Ionas</hi> ſhould ſay: I know in deede, that thou haſte no néede of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and that thou requireſt none, as though thou wert delited therwith: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore omitting them, I will do that, which both thou alloweſt before al other things,

This then is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident argument of the diuine omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, whereby we oughte to comforte oure ſelues in aduerſitie, leſt our faythe ſhoulde be vanquiſhed by the greatneſſe of any daungers.

the fame without preaching: which both Chriſte him ſelfe began, and by whoſe ſpirite the Apoſtles alſo were guided to publiſhe, by preaching the Goſpell tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out all the worlde. Hereto ſerueth the example of Cornelius, whome God admoniſhed by an Angell to ſend for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by him to heare words of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

This declaration is but ſhorte, yet ſuche a one as ſufficiently teacheth, how much he had profited in his wreſtlyng vnder the Croſſe, whereby God had chaſtened him before. For hée, who not long ſince had aſked cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of fleſh, was terrified by the reſons therof, had made himſelf yare to flée, &amp; as he was fléeing ſlept in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, now hauing hearde the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, moueth no diſputations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matter, ſhaketh of al feare, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth neuer a whit of fléeing, neither yet careleſly ſettleth himſelf to reſt and eaſe: but ſtreightwaye ariſeth, taketh his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in hand, and ordereth all his dooings according to the preſcripte of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Which very thing the holie Ghoſt doth meane, when as not without an expreſſe ſignification, he ſayeth, That he went to <hi>Niniue,</hi> according to the word of the Lorde. So that <hi>Ionas</hi> mighte haue ſayde with Dauid: <hi>It is good for mee, O God, that thou haſte brought me lovve.</hi> But, that his obedience mighte appeare the more excellente, here is interlaced a deſcription of the Citie of <hi>Niniue,</hi> with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3186:128"/>
heſe wordes: <hi>Niniue vvas a greate citie vnto God, namely of three days iourney.</hi> Reporte is made of it, that it was greate to God, whiche ſome writers ſuppoſe to be the Hebrue phraſe, as thoſe others be, wherein the Ceders of God, &amp; the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of God, are taken for greate and piked Ceders and mountains. And of ſet purpoſe doth the holie Ghoſte vſe ſuche maner of ſpeakings, to giue vs inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it muſte be aſcribed to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, whatſoeuer in this world is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or ſurmounting the reſidue.</p>
                  <p>But bicauſe this addition <hi>great,</hi> is here ſet to with this parcell or letter <hi>Lamed,</hi> which oftentimes is a ſigne of the datiue caſe, I conſente rather vnto their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, whiche interprete that <hi>Niniue</hi> was great, not onely by the eſtimation of men, but alſo by the eſtimation of God. And ſurely it muſt néedes be great vnto God, ſéeing that therin he had appointed the chief ſeate of the monarchie, which in no place elſe endured ſo many ages: ſeing alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therin he thought good to ſhewforth a ſingular proof, both of repentance, &amp; alſo
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3186:128"/>
of his owne goodneſſe. As touching that, whiche is reported of thrée dayes iorney or circuite, it accordeth with the prophane writers, which tel, that it was in meſure foure hundreth furlongs, which make vp the ſumme of fiftie myles. We haue here to behold the noble corage of <hi>Ionas,</hi> who, when as before tyme he had felte Gods iuſt &amp; mighty hand, yet now without any gaynſaying, he ſheweth himſelf obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
                  <p>Let vs imitate this Prophete, and by no kinde of impediment be pulled backe from performing that duetie, wherby we are bounde vnto God. <hi>Ionas</hi> entreth into that citie, whiche had conquered ſo many Nations, and was ladie ouer the whole Eaſt: and hauing walked therinto a days iourney (peraduenture ſtandyng in the middeſt therof) he cryeth out: <hi>There are yet fortie dayes, and then shal Niniue be ouerthrovven.</hi> And héere thou mayſte not thinke, that lyke a madde or brayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke fellowe, with confuſed and fonde clamoures, hée thundered oute theſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wordes: but as in deſcribing of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Iohn the Baptiſt, and Chriſte,

And as much as may be gathered by the order of the hiſtorie, firſte of all he fette forth his owne vocation, that the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites</hi> might vnderſtand how he was ſente vnto them from God: then afterwarde accuſed he their ſinnes, and ſhewed them that they had deſerued within forty days vtterly to periſhe, with their Citie and nation.</p>
                  <p>We haue here in this place to obſerue howe great the outragiouſneſſe of ſinnes and wickedneſſe is, in Gods ſight. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is nothing derer vnto God than man, whom of his frée grace he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the beginning, and béeing loſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemed him afterward again by the bloud of his ſonne, horrible of neceſſitie muſte that guilte be, whereby hée is moued to turne vpſetdowne whole nations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nowe that this guilt is none other
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3186:129"/>
than our ſinnes, wherwith naturally we are delited, and of many men are ſcarſly thought blame worthie, it is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, than that it néede with many words to be declared.</p>
                  <p>And as touchyng the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> that they deſerued this terrible ſentence, only in reſpect of their ſinnes, euen God hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teſtifyed in the beginnyng of thys booke, when as he willed <hi>Ionas</hi> therefore to crie out againſt them, bicauſe their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>At this day reigne the ſelfe ſame wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes, which (as before was ſayde in the firſt Homelie) reigned among the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites.</hi> But ſo much the worſer plighte are wée in, for that in them wée are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo obdurate, as that we can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to haue oure ſelues called into the right path againe, neyther by gentle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, nor by ſharpe threatenings, yea I may ſay truly, neither by manifeſt tokens of God now béeing angrie, nor yet by his plagues that he layeth vpon vs.</p>

                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:3186:130"/>And ſuche is the peruerſneſſe of a greate ſorte, that they dare blame, of too muche rigour and crueltie, the preachers of gods worde, if at any tyme they take in hand, ſomwhat ſeuerely to rebuke vices.</p>

in eſtate good inough. To theſe men came <hi>Ionas,</hi> being a man that was a ſtraunger borne of a people both hated and counted enuious, hauing acquaintaunce with none of them, neither yet ſet out with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward glory: and he bringeth a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which, as it was excéeding ſowre to delicate eares, ſo (if we will harken to carnall iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) rather was the meſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be pitied, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his meſſage to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. For who could poſſibly perſwade him ſelfe, that this moſt flouriſhing citie, where againſt no ennimie at all was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make battaile, mighte in ſo ſhorte ſpace be deſtroied, and ouerthrowen? Yet were all theſe difficulties ouercome by ſaith, which nowe ſhined in their minds, by a ſerete working of the holy ghoſt: by the which as ſoone as they are ſtirred vp, forthwith they examin their owne liues, they loke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of God, they call to mind the former examples of his olde iudgements: and bycauſe they eſpie, that many other nations haue ſodeinly come to ruine for the ſame cauſes, they rightly gather, that their owne end wil be after

the like ſorte, vnleſſe with ſpéedy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned repentance they appeaſe Gods wrath. In the example of theſe men we ſée, which is our way to walke in at thys preſent.

                  <p>Here therefore, lette vs diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, what plagues men of oure tyme are worthie to vndergo, who béeing from
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3186:136"/>
their chyldehoode trayned vp in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, and hearing bothe Chriſte and his Apoſtles, ſtill preaching vnto them dayly, yet with no admonitions or examples, can be broughte to amende.</p>
                  <p>But aboue al, the example of this king is worthie of remembraunce,<note place="margin">The dutie of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</note> as by the whiche all Princes are put in mynde of their duetie. They are ordeyned of God, both to vphold his worſhip, &amp; alſo to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine common peace: whiche that they may the better bring to paſſe, God hath committed vnto them his owne ſtatutes, leaſt eyther by ignoraunce béeing decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or by blynde affections caried away, they ſhoulde treade out of the right path. Firſt of al therfore, they muſt ſuffer gods woorde to haue a roomth amongeſt them, and not thynke them ſelues exempte from that duetie of obedience, whereby all other degrées of men are bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.

Secondly, they muſt alſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſhew foorth example of godlineſſe vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For in aſmuch as the moſte parte of men couet to pleaſe their kings, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thyng make they their chief practiſe, than to imitate their manners? So that that ſaying of the Poet, is found true:
<q>
                        <l>As Princes mynde to chaunge their way,</l>
                        <l>Th'vnconstant people vſe to ſway.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore in two reſpectes is honeſtie of lyfe required in Magiſtrates: bothe for that it is meete for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and alſo for that they muſte take diligent heede, leaſt by their owne exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, they bring others in like maner to offend. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the Prophets trauailed ſo much in reprehending the maners of Princes, euen for that they can not ſinne without giuing of common offence vnto many. But bicauſe all men do not of their owne accorde performe their dutie, neyther fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the examples of good Princes, the thirde thing neceſſarie to be had, is good lawes and ordinances, wherby they may pricke forward ſuch as are dul, and bring in ſubiection thoſe that are rebellious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:3186:137"/>Howbeit, then ſhall lawes haue greateſt authoritie, if the people may vnderſtand, that they agrée with Gods word. If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates were bente thus to deale nowe adayes, we ſhould ſee a notable and frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full chaunge, of all degrees and ſortes of men. Magiſtrates make their greateſt complaint in a maner of their diſordered licentiouſneſſe among the people:<note place="margin">Cauſes of diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people.</note> but in the meane while very fewe doe rightely weigh the cauſes therof: amongſt which theſe two are the chiefeſt, namely, the contempt of Gods word being preached, and the euill example that is ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>And either of theſe ſpringeth from the magiſtrates, as from the fountaine, and from thence is ſpread abrode among the common people. For let any one be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the whole number of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whiche earneſtly thinketh in his minde, that he ought to be ſubiect to the worde of God. Many in déede there be, that can be contente to admitte it. But when? Euen at ſuche tyme, as it putteth them in any hope of carnall libertie, and not otherwyſe. And thus commeth it to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3186:138"/>
paſſe, that they themſelues ſhewe euill example: and as for lawes, eyther they make none at all, or if they make any, by their owne naughtie lyues, they pull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie, ſo being lyke vnhuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandly huſbandmen, that breake downe the hedges, whiche earewhyle they had ſette vp.</p>

The firſt telleth what muſt be done. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde conteineth a cauſe thereof. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the firſt, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth three thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

                        <hi>1.</hi> There is enioyned a publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> which (as lately we decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) conſiſteth chiefly in faſtings, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie of apparell. For as men do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bewray their wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe by ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketting, and riottous attiring of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, ſo if at any tyme they perceiue, that God is angrie with them, they are bound to teſtifie the ſame by abſtinence &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. This then is the kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aſwel men as beaſts, &amp; al kind of cattel, abſteine from meate and drink,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3186:138"/>
and put on ſackcloath. It mighte ſéeme a thing worthie of deriſion here, whiche is ſpoken as concerning beaſtes and cattel. But we muſt think, that all liuing thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are created for mans behoofe, and that therfore do appeare by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tokens both of Gods wrath &amp; alſo of his fauour. Againe, ſeing the vngodly by meanes of their bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and cattell, and vnmeaſurable hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of wyld beaſtes, do make as it were open bragges of their exceſſe and pryde: It is méete, that euen by the ſame they ſhewe proofe afterwarde of their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, whereby they ſubmitte themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to God, when he correcteth.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, this is a matter of greate moment, to moue vs to repentaunce, if euen in brute beaſtes we conſider the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods wrath, which by our owne ſinnes we haue prouoked. Neyther may it ſéeme ſtraunge vnto vs, that this king of <hi>Niniue</hi> coulde perceiue theſe thinges, ſith the verie Gentiles and Heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had dayly experiences herof in their Sacrifices, whyche they offered for the purging of their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:3186:139"/>Howbeit, here by the waye, let vs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly obſerue, that all theſe outwarde things can nothing auayle in Gods ſight, except they be directed to their ende and meaning, which is, that we beeing whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrite in hearte, offer vp oure ſelues a quicke ſacrifice vnto him. For if there lye hidden any counterfaite dealing, we ſhal rather offend God, who being Truth it ſelf, can away w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> no coloring or deceyt. So then theſe things do nothing help the Papiſtes cauſe, who would place repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it ſelfe in theſe outwarde thinges, which neuertheleſſe for the moſte parte deceiue, except they be directed by a true faith. Secondly, the kyng warneth his ſubiectes to fall to prayer, ſaying: <hi>Lette them crie myghtily vnto god.</hi> He nameth but one God, ſo that euen hence a man may gather, that bothe hée was loathed with feigned gods, and that <hi>Ionas</hi> alſo in his ſermons did often beate in, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſayings, the iudgemente of the one and verie God. His requeſte is, for mightie cryings of the people vnto God, that is, feruente and vnceſſant Prayers:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3186:139"/>
and ſéeing that he giueth admonition of them, it may ſufficiently appere, that he attributed not ſo muche to thoſe external exerciſes, whereof lately was ſpoken,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> He requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lyfe and maners.</note> as to beleeue that they were able to ſatiſfie for ſinnes. Thirdly he addeth: <hi>Yea, ſee that euery man tourne from his euyll vvays, &amp; from the extortion that he hath in hande.</hi> In theſe wordes hée toucheth the chiefe point of repentance, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in turning to God, &amp; amendement of lyfe. This worde, <hi>vvaye,</hi> ſignifieth the maner of life, that they embraced, being in all degrées moſt corrupt. But aboue all other, he thought good to make mention of their extortion, bicauſe therin they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended. For as by rauine and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they were clymed vp to ſo high a top of dignitie, ſo alſo that their welth might ſuffiſe for their riot and intemperancie, they dayly put in vre ſtrange oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; inuented new kinds of legierdemaine, as wherby they might draw other mens ſubſtance to themſelues. In his mention making therfore of their euill way and extortion, his meaning is to enioyn them

The other is how he was reprehended by God: who therwithal giueth open teſtimonie of his fatherly good affection toward mankynd. And this parte alſo belongeth to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of repentance, which is the whole ſcope of this booke. For it teacheth, howe the Saints and holy men ſomtimes after they are conuerted from their ſinnes, and haue taſted of the grace of God, yet fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and neuertheleſſe feele God verie gracious vnto them.

This errour hath ben of ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author wherof was
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3186:143"/>
one <hi>Nouatus,</hi> a prieſte of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the yeare after Chriſts incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation two hundreth and fiftie, and was in times paſt occaſion of no litle diſquiet in the Church. Now a daies it is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe by the Anabaptiſts, who make in a manner the whole drifte of all theyr endeuours, to bring confuſion into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and by wonderfull terroures of conſcience to drawe away ſimple men vnawares, from the communion and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of ſuche Chriſtian aſſemblies. Wherefore the conſidering of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may not be negligently paſſed ouer in any wiſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſte thing here deſcribed, is <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> offence. <hi>He vvas ſore diſcontente, and angry in him ſelfe.</hi> Here are expreſſed two affections, namely griefe and anger, which ſpring of our naturall corruption, and cauſe men to committe heinous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. How farre awrie theſe affections were in <hi>Ionas,</hi> it may manifeſtly appere, by the occaſion whereof they ſprong. He was diſcontente for that God ſpared the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> vnto whome, at his owne bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3186:144"/>
he had denounced deſtruction. So then <hi>Ionas</hi> contenciouſly fighteth againſt the will of God, and by that meanes ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth very grieuouſly. But ſo muche the more heynous is this offence, for that he is not only diſcontent with the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion of God, but ſo is he diſcontent that he alſo ſorroweth in his minde: yea and that againe in ſuche ſort, that he is angry alſo, bycauſe the matter falleth out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than he before had ſaid it ſhould do. And ſéeing euery iote thereof depended vpon Gods pleaſure, we muſt néedes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he was angrie euen with God him ſelfe. But what thing can be more ſhamefull, more arrogante, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, than that man, which is mortal, fooliſh, and a ſinner, ſhould with blind and raſh furie, ſtorme againſt God, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, who knoweth all thinges, and is moſt iuſt? Surely this horrible treſpaſſe is ſo great, as that there can be broughte or imagined no cauſes ſo honeſt, ſo iuſt, or ſo neceſſary, as may excuſe the ſame. But let vs ſée, what moued <hi>Ionas</hi> to be ſo much diſpleaſed at Gods doing. Firſt,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3186:144"/>
he perceiued, that the fame &amp; honoure of his name ſtode now in ſome hazard, and that it wanted not much, but that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he ſhould be accompted a lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and very vaine. Beſides this, he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it an vnworthy thing, that the grace of God ſhould be extended alſo vnto the Gentiles, whiche the Iewes thought pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to belong to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues and none other: peraduenture alſo he ſtode in ſome doubte of his owne countrey men, bicauſe he had conueyed ouer the worde of God eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, and was the cauſer, both that they conuerted, &amp; alſo that they were partakers of ſo great grace. For it is not vnknowen vnto vs, how arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the Iewes looked alofte, by reaſon of their prerogatiue, and how cruelly they had al other nacions in deſpite: ſith euen in the Apoſtles times they that beléeued were angrie with Peter, bycauſe he wente in,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.</note> and preached to the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles: &amp; Paule alſo had this obiected vnto him, as an offence worthy of deathe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts.</hi> 21.</note> that he had broughte in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vncircumciſed into the temple. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I doubt, but that <hi>Ionas</hi> cloked this
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3186:145"/>
priuate affection of anger, wherewithall he was ſo muche moued, with this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence. By the whiche place we are put in mind, how greatly the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the fleſh can preuaile in vs, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if they put on a ſhewe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for then they forcibly drawe man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way paſt all bounds of ſéemelyneſſe and honeſtie, yea rather of godlineſſe it ſelfe. So did the Apoſtles by a prepoſterous zeale, folowing their affection, deſire, that fire might be ſente downe from heauen, thus coueting to make Chriſte the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their reuengemente, who to thys ende was come into the worlde, that he might ſaue men. Luke. 9. A diligente re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde therefore muſt be had, leſt we mixe our zeale to religion with the affections of the fleſhe: whiche ſame thing hath ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times deceiued men, bothe good and very holy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ionas falleth to quarelling with God.</note>For <hi>Ionas</hi> is not onely angry, but ſo muche féedeth he the humoure of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and anger, that he frameth a grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous complainte againſt God, wherein he goeth aboute to accuſe him, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe

his owne flying away, yea for the whiche not long before he had ſuffred ſo ſore puniſhment. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vvas not this my ſaying</hi> (I pray thée) <hi>vvhen I vvas yet in mine ovvne countrey? &amp;c.</hi> He faſhioneth his talke in manner of a prayer: howebeit very bitterly dothe he prefer his owne iudgemente, before the ordinance of God For ſo dealeth he, as though he ſhoulde ſay: Thou thoughteſt, that I did vnſéemely and diſloially, when as, bycauſe I would not come to <hi>Niniue,</hi> I ſoughte to reſigne ouer thy ſeruice, and made redy to flee vnto <hi>Tharſis.</hi> But they were weightie cauſes, that draue me to take this voiage in hande. For euen then did I ſee, what would come to paſſe. I knew well inough, that thou arte gentle and mercifull: whereby I eaſely coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, what would be the ſequele: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Niniuites</hi> being once conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto thée, thou wouldeſt draw backe thy hand, yea though it wer redy &amp; ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out to ſmite, and by that meanes ſet foorth not only mine owne authoritie, but alſo the certeinty and truth of thy word,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3186:146"/>
to be laughed to ſcorne of the vngodly. Therefore thought I it wiſdome to flée, leſt any ſuch thing ſhould happen. &amp;c. Let vs now (in good ſooth) take a viewe, howe many and how great ſinnes méete here togither. Firſt of al, that offence of fleing, whereof he had before repented, he nowe beginneth a freſh to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte, whiles that ſo preſumptuouſly he defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it, and by defending thereof, accuſeth God of wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing, bycauſe, as he was a fleing, he had laid ſo ſore a puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Beſides this he preferreth his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome before God, laying to his charge vnaduiſed raſhneſſe, for that he ſent hym euer to the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g not firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly proued, what the end of this matter would be. Againe, he blameth God for thoſe his moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable vertues, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes, mercy, bountifulneſſe, and lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Moreouer, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his owne eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion might be aduanced, he could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente to haue the moſt excellente citie of the whole world quite ourthrowen. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he here ſtay himſelfe, but that he alſo wiſheth for death, ſeing there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3186:146"/>
no other way wherby to reme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy ſo great a diſpleaſure. <hi>Take my life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me (I beſeech thee) for it is better for me to die, than to liue.</hi> Nowe, in ſo ſpeaking he ſinneth very greatly. For in as much as the life which we haue, we haue it not of our ſelues, but by the gifte of God, it is not conueniente, that we ſhould take in hand, to leaue it off at our owne priuate pleaſure: but rather it becommeth vs to be redie, therewith to do God ſeruice, as long as he will haue vs in this ſtage play to play our parte. The ſame affection did God long ſince reproue in Helias, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he vpon like occaſion deſired to die, that he might be diſpatched of thoſe troubles, cares, and daungers, that he ſawe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinualy moleſted with al. And this is a great argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our frowardneſſe, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our life being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift of god, yet we in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner diſdaine to vſe it to Gods glory.

him true ſaluation, yet of purpoſed mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mind caſt him off, bicauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the worlde and the loue thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eternall life. To ſuch as theſe are, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Chriſte himſelfe denieth, that theyr ſinne ſhall be remitted: and of the ſame is it that Iohn ſpeaketh, ſaying: <hi>There is a ſinne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>for vvhiche ſay I not, that a man ſhould pray.</hi> And that this is it, whereof the Apoſtle to the Hebrues doth mean, we are taughte by that diligent reherſall whiche he maketh of the enlightning, of the heauenly gifte, and of the powers of the world to come: all whiche things are allotted vnto vs by the holy ghoſt, whom alſo he expreſſely nameth. So then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good aduiſemente do they extend that to euery fall, whiche the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of this only kind of ſin. Again, his words are not ſimply of repentaunce, but of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing or regeneration: the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe whereof is the holy Ghoſt, and the ende repentance: which newe birth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole life of man, &amp; ordereth it according to the preſcripte of Gods will. And ſuch as ſinne againſt the holy ghoſt,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3186:149"/>
he denieth, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be renued to this repentance: ſo doth he both ſhew that the cauſe of this vncurable miſchiefe is in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and alſo acquiteth God of all ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe of crueltie. In prouing whereof, he vſeth two arguments. The firſt is, that they whiche of purpoſed impietie haue ſhaken Chriſt off, haue no remedy lefte, whereby to recouer ſaluation againe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte God ſhould afreſh giue his ſonne to be crucified, and made a mocking ſtocke. But bycauſe God will neuer do ſo, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it with equitie, that he ſhuld appointe a newe merite of ſaluation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch, as haue reiected the former: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it vnpoſſible, that the ſame men ſhould be renewed, and receiued into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure againe. The other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth from their diſpoſition and nature: declaring, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe kind of men are of their number, from whom we can hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that good is. And here he vſeth a fine parable. As the nature of the ſoile is knowne by the fruites that come thereof, and moſt certeinly that is bleſſed of god, whiche being watered with ſhoures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3186:150"/>
fruteful: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe it is a manifeſt toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of curſed and deſperate ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, if neither by ſhoures it can be ſoftned, nor yet by laboure tilled, to yelde encreaſe: So, if any be of ſuch wilfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie, as that there can be no good done amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by thoſe meanes of the holy ghoſt, wherby God is wont to enlighten his children, to draw them, &amp; make them partakers of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what further hope may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? by what meanes can they be repaired and wonne agayne? For ſith the holy ghoſt alone hath the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; authoritie ouer our minds, paſt all hope (of neceſſitie) muſt their malice be, which either refuſe to giue him place that he may enter, or wickedly caſt him off again, hauing bene once admitted in. Howbeit far otherwiſe is the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the elect, to whome the ſame happeneth, which by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we ſée in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good ſoile. For as in it ſomtime through careleſnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſbandmen, ther grow vp nettles &amp; briers, yet abideth it tilling, and theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once rooted out, it receiueth good ſéed: So alſo the godly &amp; elect, being ouercome
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3186:150"/>
with the fantaſies of the fleſh, neglecte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauaile about their owne minds, and by this occaſion there ſpring vp of al ſorts of vices in them: yet, when as afterwarde they are tilled a new by the word of god, and made frutefull by the ſeede thereof, they bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g forth frutes worthy of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, prouoketh gods wrath againſt himſelfe: yet being penitent, God receiueth him into his fauour. We réede alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtle Peter,<note place="margin">

No. He doth rather, after he hath friendly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, teach him to be of a better iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Neither doth he only robbe <hi>Ionas</hi> of this moſt pleſaunte ſhadowe, but he procureth a loude or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement winde alſo, whiche mighte more encreaſe the heate of the ſunne, ſuche as the Eaſt is in manner wont to be,<note place="margin">Eurus, ab v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo.</note> which amongſt the Hebrues (as alſo among the Heluetians) toke his name of burning, as other where we haue ſaide.

For who will not accompt it a verie chyldiſh thing, that ſo great a Prophet is ſo ioyfull of a ſhrubbe, as that he doth not once thinke, for what vſe God made it.

But if it ſo fal out, that God plucketh awaye the ſame from vs againe, forthwith we are in ſuch ſorte ſwalowed vp with ſorow and heuineſſe, that we run headlong into deſperation, as though in the whole world there could no way be deuiſed, wherby to releue our neceſſitie. Nowe, if any man dare be ſo venturous, as to reproue and blame this our follie and impaciencie, then are wée not aſhamed to defende our owne cauſe, and to bring oure action againſt God, as though contrarie to right and equitie hée had taken from vs ſomewhat, that was our owne before.

                     <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence of God.</note>Then, is there againe ſet forth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the deuine prouidence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things, as well litle as great are ſo kepte togither, that it is vnpoſſible for any thing to be without the limits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For beſides that manifeſt arguments thereof were plainely to be ſéene in the winds, in the ſea, in the whale, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the wild vine ſodenly ſprong vp, and as ſoone withered away againe: nowe at this preſent he teſtifieth that he hath not only a care ouer the Citie, but alſo he bringeth in a certaine number of infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and doth moreouer make mencion of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, as which he could not choſe but haue ſome regard of. As touching infants, that God is carefull for them, the Scripture doth euery where teach, and eſpecially Chriſt, who affirmeth, that certaine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are appointed vnto them, and that the kingdome of God dothe belong vnto them. So then the madneſſe of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes is the rather to be hiſſed out, who driue away childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as though God
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3186:165"/>
had nothing to deale with them) from the congregation, whiche is the outwarde kingdome of God. Here alſo by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God are condemned ſuche, as take no care ouer the children, whome themſelues haue begotten: and do either ſhamefully neglecte them, or as yet more, by their vngracious bringing vp, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell example corrupte them. Let them (in Gods name) call to minde what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmente they are worthy of, by the iudgemente of God, who is ſo farre from hauing vs to neglecte oure children, that he hathe ordeined eſpeciall lawes for beaſts and cattell, yea euen for the yong birds. Loke Exod. <hi>20.</hi> and <hi>.23.</hi> And Deute. <hi>22.</hi> &amp;c. In the meane ſeaſon let there from hence be fetched a conſolation, bothe for parents, and alſo for common wealthes, whiche thinke the multitude of children or people to be ſuche, as may not well be borne with all: and do therefore ſtande in dread, leaſt they ſhould become deſtitute of things neceſſarie. God knoweth the certaine number, how many dwell in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery family and Citie. He is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3186:166"/>
alſo, what things they haue néede of. And the ſame God which féedeth the birds of the aire and prouideth paſture for the cattell, will not be careleſſe ouer ſuch as depend vpon him. Math. <hi>6.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The iustice of God, who moderateth the rigoure of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with mercie.</note>Beſides all this, let vs thoroughly marke the iuſtice of God, who dothe ſo moderate the rigoure of his iudgements with his mercie, that no man can iuſtly vtter any complainte againſt him. For if ſo be that he hath regarde to infants, and cattell, yea euen at ſuch time, as he intendeth to cut off whole cities by the rootes, who can doubt, but that he hathe an eſpecial reſpect vnto all and ſinguler the Godly, who for the moſt part haue wicked and vngodly mingled amongſt them? So in times paſt ſaued he Noe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the floud, and Loth from the burning of Sodome. And when as he brought hys plagues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Egypt</hi> yet according to his wiſdome he knew, how to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene his ennemies and hys owne people, leſt they ſhould be wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in both the one and the other, in the like calamities. Let this be marked of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3186:166"/>
them, whiche (being offended with that vniuerſall licenciouſneſſe in ſinning, that now a daies reigneth euery where) ſtande in dread, that them ſelues do in vaine ſtudy after godlineſſe, ſeing they alſo of neceſſitie muſt periſhe with the vngodly. The cauſe of this erronious doubt is, for that they meaſure God by their owne braine: and bycauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues can ſee no way howe to eſcape, therefore they ſuppoſe, that God alſo wanteth meanes, how to ſaue and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thoſe that are his. Howbeit farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe is the maner of Gods dealing, who <hi>calleth thoſe things that be not,</hi>

                     <hi>as though they vvere,</hi> and ſodenly out of darkneſſe can bring forth light: neyther ſuffereth his iudgements at any time, to be caried with a blinde and vnconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate violence. Which that we may the better vnderſtand, he hath ſet foorthe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this matter, euen in thoſe thinges whiche ſéeme to be wroughte, yea rather are wroughte in déede, by the lauful courſe of nature, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. For although the earth doth vnto
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3186:167"/>
the vpper region of the aire euerywhere make deliueraunce of vapours, whyche be the matter wherevpon the rayne is made: yet doth not the rayne water the earth euery where at once, but it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned at Gods becke and pleaſure, to rain vpon one citie, and not on an other: As before wée haue hearde declared in Amos chapter <hi>.4.</hi> So lykewyſe when the hayle falleth doune with terrible ſtorme, ſo as it ſhoulde ſéeme to laye all thinges waſte, bothe farre and wyde, yet is it no ſeldome ſéene thing, that in one and the ſelfe ſame coaſt of a countrey, ſome mens fieldes and vineyardes are beaten flatte with the grounde, ſome other mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning vnhurt and vntouched. But he that taketh this héede in things withoute lyfe, ſhall we think, that he goth on with blynde rage agaynſt men?</p>
                  <p>Hereto accompt, that euen in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes of Cities and nations, all are not in the lyke hazarde at all tymes. For it commeth often to paſſe, that whyleſt ſome myſerably periſhe, other ſome fynd fauour among their enimies, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3186:167"/>
amongſt them to great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honor: as the examples of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie, Daniell, and his fellowes, wil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teache vs.</p>
                  <p>And among the <hi>Turkes</hi> manye ſuche thinges haue hapned: as they can make reporte, who at any time haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant with them. Yea, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſometime Cities verie populous are horribly deſtroyed, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes, women, and olde aged men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet dothe not this hinder the matter. For God dothe not (for all this) paſſe the bounds of Iuſtice and mercie. For if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rule of the law we examine all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams poſteritie, of what ſoeuer age or ſexe, we ſhal fynd that no one is without faulte, and therefore no one ſuffereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniurie. Conſequently, oure owne fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe doth euen craue thus muche, that God would nowe and then by ſuche outwarde examples teſtifie his wrathe againſt ſinne, leaſt otherwyſe we flatter our ſelues in ſinne continually.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, if there be any more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente than the reſidue, whether they bée
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3186:168"/>
yong infants, or old men ſtouping down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde for age, yet ſuſteyne they no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, though in theſe things they take like parte with the vngodly. For oute of the wreſtling place of this world, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with calamities, they are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp into heauen, and receyue the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting rewarde.</p>
                  <p>Lette no man therfore finde fault with God in his iudgements, who as he is iuſt ſo is he alſo accuſtomed with a fatherlye good wil to embrace ſuche as are his, and to appoynt their Saluation, as the ſhote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchor and finall ende of all his dooings.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A briefe ſumme of the historie of Ionas.</note>Thus much, according to the quantitie of the talent, wherewith I am putte in truſt, haue I entreated vpon the hiſtorie of Ionas, it ſetteth forth repentance, and doth not only make manifeſt al the trade thereof by three examples, but alſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, that it is acceptable and effectual with God.

                  <p>All theſe thinges whiche herein are
